# Halithor's Recipe System
This system provides a generic way to register items and recipes in for custom
maps made for Warcraft III using the [Wurst language](https://wurstlang.org/). 

# Usage
Everything is setup via the configuration file which the user provides. Direct 
calls to the recipe system will be done through `unit.craftRecipe()` and similar functions. *TODO(Halithor): write more*

# Todo

- Recipes with multiple, counted products
- Partial recipe completion: recipes that can take many resources
- "Recipe books" based on the recipes defined. Easy text tools
- Configuration for abilities causing recipe attempts
